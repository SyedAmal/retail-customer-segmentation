# $$$ Retail Customer Segmentation & Sales Insights

This project analyzes real-world e-commerce transaction data to uncover customer behavior patterns and segment users using RFM analysis and unsupervised machine learning (KMeans Clustering). It also provides product insights, sales trends, and business-ready summaries.

##  Dataset
